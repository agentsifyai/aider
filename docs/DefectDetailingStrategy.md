# Defect Detailing Strategy

Defect Detailing is a process of taking a defect and inferring the needed details from the report content.

Defect identification process itself does not predict a lack of data - defect needs minimally an existing damage information and the place the damage is located. 

Defect detailing however must consider any kind of lack of data. As the detailing strategy is a "continuation" of the general defect analysis process in this strategy we may consider only the data that can be expected for given kind of report. Ideally, we should expect the unexpected; considering that even if we think the data about a specific detail is usually absent, we should try to get it.

## Details:
 - **Verbose Defect Description**: This detail field corresponds to any desribable details regarding the defect. Usually it is done for reports containing some verbose information or images (they are being transormed into alt descriptors in the data conversion step)
